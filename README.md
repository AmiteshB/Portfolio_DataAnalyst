# CyclisticBikeShare_CaseStudy
A case study which involves a bike sharing company based in chicago called Cyclistic. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate my data analytics skills by gaining insights and using the insights to promote growth of the company.

## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. Oneapproach that helped make these things possible was the
exibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
 
### Deliverable: Business Task
The director of marketing has a hypothesis that in order to grow their revenue they need people to purchase more annual memberships and for this to happen, they want to convert more casual customers to annual members. My team needs to figure out how casual and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently so that we can create a new strategy for marketing. These insights need to be backed by data in order to get approval from the executive team.

<b>Stakeholder Expectations</b>
- Executive Team: Insights that are backed by real world data and can help to grow the company.
- Director of marketing: Data driven evidence to back up her hypothesis and recommendations.
