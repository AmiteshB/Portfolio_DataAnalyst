# CyclisticBikeShare_CaseStudy
A case study which involves a bike sharing company based in chicago called Cyclistic. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate my data analytics skills by gaining insights and using the insights to promote growth of the company.

### Deliverable: Business Task
The director of marketing has a hypothesis that in order to grow their revenue they need people to purchase more annual memberships and for this to happen, they want to convert more casual customers to annual members. My team needs to figure out how casual and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently so that we can create a new strategy for marketing. These insights need to be backed by data in order to get approval from the executive team.

<b>Stakeholder Expectations</b>
- Executive Team: Insights that are backed by real world data and can help to grow the company.
- Director of marketing: Data driven evidence to back up her hypothesis and recommendations.
